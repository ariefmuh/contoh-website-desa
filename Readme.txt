Hello Dev here!
Welcome to my website project, built using native PHP but designed with a structure similar to the Laravel framework.

Key Features:
1. Laravel-like Template System:
    A. Implemented include and section functionalities for modular and reusable layouts.
    B. Separate base layout and dynamic content pages for better organization.
2. Data Management:
    A. Tables can be customized with DataTables or any other JavaScript table library for enhanced interactivity.
    B. Built-in CRUD functionality for managing data.

Instructions:
1. Feel free to modify the layout files (base.php, navbar.php, sidebar.php) to suit your needs.
2. If you want to integrate a JavaScript table library:
    A. Include the required library files (e.g., DataTables CSS/JS).
    B. Initialize the library on the desired tables in the JavaScript section.
